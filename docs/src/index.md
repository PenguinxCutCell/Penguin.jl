## Introduction and Quickstart

Julia Implementation of Cut-Cell method for (now) :
- Scalar Elliptic Problems
- Scalar Parabolic Problems
- Scalar Advection-Diffusion-Reaction Problems
- Solid Moving Boundaries
- Monophasic or Diphasic Problems
- Darcy Flow Solver
- Phase Change Interface motion (1D, 2D and 3D (height function only))
- Fully-Coupled Stokes/Navier-Stokes Solver for Monophasic and Diphasic (static interface) Flows

Under development :
- Phase Change with Navier-Stokes coupling
- Preconditioning
